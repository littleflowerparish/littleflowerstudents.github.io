         <b><i>Welcome to my website!</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>
          When I grow up, I would like to be a computer programmer or a photographer. Or an author.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in Indianapolis IN and I am in fifth grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have two sisters and a brother.
        </p>
        <h3>

            <p>One of my favorite games is Magic: The Gathering. It is the best trading card game of all time!</p>

            <p>In the future, I hope to own the world's most popular website. I would be on the news and my afternoon would be booked with cofreneces all over the world!</p>
            <p>Something that I am looking forward to is the new Infinity War movie.</p>
            <p>My favorite sport is baseball, but my favorite sport to watch is golf.</p>
            <p>My favorite band is Steam Powered Giraffe.</p>
            <p>A movie I saw recently is the Black Panther movie. I still think the comics are a bit better. All the good superheroes are cooler in the comics.</p>
            <p> In class, we are making our own utopias.</p>
            <p>My favorite sport to watch is golf. A lot of people think it is the most boring sport ever, but I think it is actually very exciting. It is fun to see the really close shots that Justin Thomas just barely makes, or Patrick Reed making snarky commentsafter missing a super close putt.</p>
